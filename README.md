# ForceLab
ForceLab is a Virtual Physics Lab using Unity and 3D physics technology designed explicitly for secondary school students aiming at improving their comprehension regarding physical laws emanating from an analysis involving various types of forces. This projectâ€™s motivation arises from empirical evidence demonstrating that numerous pupils often encounter challenges when studying critical subjects like physics, particularly when it comes to understanding the concept of forces. This project aims at alleviating such hurdles by establishing an interactive learning ecosystem promoting engagement; whereby understanding of forces can gradually improve among pupils leading to their improved overall performance in physics.
